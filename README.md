## Testing

#### *ATTENTION*: Since the necessary inputs in the project are taken via the console, if the tests need to be run in a way that includes black box tests, such as running all the tests together or only running blackbox tests, the steps specified in the `Utility.java` must be applied. Because in the tests produced with Randoop, input is expected from the console.
