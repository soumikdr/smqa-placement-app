## Meeting Outcome - 3rd November, 2024

### Summary

During this meeting, we collectively reviewed the developed user stories, assessing their alignment with project goals and requirements. We finalized a total of 50 user stories. To estimate development effort, we utilized the planning poker game to assign story points using fibonacci nummbers with minimum value of 1 and maximum value of 13 to half of the total user stories.

## Meeting Outcome - 9th November, 2024

### Summary

In this group meeting, we continued the planning poker game to assign story points to the remaining user stories. We then grouped these stories into 14 distinct activities or tasks (A-Q) for inclusion in our PERT chart.

## Meeting Outcome - 10th November, 2024

### Summery

As we finalized on our user story categories (activities), we designed network flow diagram (PERT Chart) and have done the calculations for it in this meeting. The critical path is also generated in the PERT chart. For the duration unit, we have decided to go with 'DAY' rather than weeks to make it look like more understandable. <br /><br />We have also used basic COCOMO to predict the cost of our software development project. To estimate the effort E, the development time D and the required number of people P using COCOMO, we supposed the development context is chosen as organic. <br /><br />In the meeting, it is also decided that we will start our project sprints starting from 19th November, each sprint spanning for 2 weeks.

## Sprint Meeting - 19th November, 2024

### Summery

In our first sprint meeting, We allocated user stories to the sprints based on PERT chart activities, considering the predecessor dependencies and the estimated times. Each user story is assigned to a priority level. Also, user story issues assigned among us keeping equal work distribution in mind.
