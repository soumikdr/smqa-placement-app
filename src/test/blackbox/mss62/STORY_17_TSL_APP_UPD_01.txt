TEST CASE: TSL_APP_UPD_01
METHOD: updateProfile(User updatedUser)
DESCRIPTION: Verifies that the provided updated user replaces the old version in the user list and becomes the new current user state.

PRECONDITIONS:
  - The system user list contains an Applicant user with ID = "A200".
  - The user’s current firstName = "OldName", lastName = "OldLast".
  - The user is also the current user in the system.

ACTIONS:
  1. Construct an updatedUser object with the same ID = "A200" but
     firstName = "NewName", lastName = "NewLast".
  2. Call updateProfile(updatedUser).

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
  - The user list no longer contains "OldName OldLast" for ID = "A200".
  - Instead, it contains "NewName NewLast" for ID = "A200".
  - The system’s current user also reflects the updated information.
